# NTU-MUN-2015Front
This was the website I had built for the Nanyang Technological University Model United Nations 2015. I made use of Bootstrap, Javascript and some JQuery libraries (elaborated below). 
While the code was rudimentary, I particularly enjoyed using specific UI features, which I have mentioned below:-

1) The  landing page with a side 'hamburger' navigation gives a minimalistic yet interactive homepage. When a user hovers on a particular logo, the logo brightens as the entire page is mapped using the rwdImageMaps JQuery library.

First experiences are especially important for a user's impression, and I made sure that there is no lag in image changes by preloading all images using a javascript function to preload images.
